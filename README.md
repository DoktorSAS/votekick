# PlutoT6 Votekick
Given the use of Black ops II I decided to create a simple Votekick system. In fact through the console 
it will be possible to vote to hunt a player who does not respect the rules.
The moderators can not always be online, so players can hunt the bad guys if they agree.

**How to use it?**
1. Download the **_scoreboard.gsc**
2. Drag and drop the file into your **gametypes** folder

| Prefix #1 | Prefix #2 | command | description                                                                                            |
|-----------|-----------|:-------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| votekick  | vk        | list    | This command is to see all players id                                                                  |
| votekick  | vk        | ID      | The ID is a number, put the ID of the players that you want to kick. This command is to start votekick |
| votekick  | vk        | yes     | This is to vote yes to the votekick                                                                    |
| votekick  | vk        | no      | This is to vote no to the votekick                                                                     |
