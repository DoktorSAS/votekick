# PlutoT6 Votekick
Given the use of Black ops II I decided to create a simple Votekick system. In fact through the console 
it will be possible to vote to hunt a player who does not respect the rules.
The moderators can not always be online, so players can hunt the bad guys if they agree.

**How to use it?**
1. Download the **_scoreboard.gsc**
2. Drag and drop the file into your **gametypes** folder
